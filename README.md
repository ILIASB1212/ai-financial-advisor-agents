# üí∞ Dynamic Finance Crew: Investment Strategy Generator
Welcome to the Dynamic Finance Crew project, a multi-agent system built with CrewAI designed to generate customized investment strategies based on dynamic client profiles (Growth, Defensive, Long-Term, Short-Term).

This project successfully transitioned from a rigid, static model to a dynamic, goal-aligned engine by creating specialized agents and integrating external data APIs.

## üöÄ Key Features
Dynamic Client Profiling: The system adapts its filtering criteria (Beta, FCF, Revenue Growth) based on the client's stated risk tolerance (1-10) and primary goal (e.g., Aggressive Accumulation vs. Capital Preservation).

- Specialized Toolset: Integration of multiple custom tools for precise financial analysis and risk vetting.

- End-to-End Workflow: The crew handles intake, research, quantitative filtering, qualitative risk assessment, portfolio allocation, and final reporting.

- Web Interface (Streamlit): Deployed via app.py for easy user input and visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup & Installation
This project uses Python >=3.10 and requires external libraries and API keys to run effectively.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to your project root and install the required packages:

pip install crewai crewai-tools pandas yfinance google-api-python-client python-dotenv streamlit

### 2. API Key Configuration (Crucial)
Your agents rely on external services. You MUST define these keys securely.

Key Name

Service

Purpose

OPENAI_API_KEY

OpenAI (LLM)

Powers all agent reasoning and tool usage.

AV_API_KEY

Alpha Vantage

Provides financial metrics (FCF, P/E, SMA) via the Financial Scraper Tool.

GOOGLE_API_KEY

Google Cloud Console

Powers the custom Google Search Tool for qualitative news/context.

For Local Testing: Create a .env file in the root directory and add your keys.
For Streamlit Cloud: Add these keys to your Streamlit App Secrets ([secrets]).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Tools Implemented
The following highly specialized tools (defined as Python functions with the @tool decorator) are integrated into the workflow:

Agent

Tool

Description

Market Analyst

GoogleSearchTool

## üèÉ Running the Application
Method

Command

Notes

Web Interface (Recommended)

streamlit run app.py

Launches the interactive client input form.

Command Line (CLI)

$ crewai run

Runs the full sequence for debugging and testing the core workflow.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Mismatches & Solutions (For Developers)
- The project required extensive debugging due to framework conflicts and initial data errors. These are the major breakthroughs achieved:

-- Tool Argument Error Fix: Resolved TypeError: tool() got an unexpected keyword argument 'args_schema' by implementing the nested BaseModel class syntax inside each decorated tool function.

-- Context Mapping Fix: Resolved AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get' by ensuring all task dependencies (context:) are defined using the correct YAML list syntax (- task_name).

-- Data Persistence Fix (The $1M Problem): The code was successfully refactored to a dynamic structure where agent filtering criteria adapt based on the client's actual financial profile and timeline.

--LLM Failure Fix: Resolved the litellm.AuthenticationError in the cloud by relying on the st.secrets injection in app.py.

Let's create wonders together with the power and simplicity of crewAI.
